			<h4>What are my expectations of the class?</h4>
    		<p id = "What are my expectations of the class?">
    		I expect to learn of the various tools and methods used in software development in the industry
			today. I have a bit of knowledge about web and mobile development; so, I am expecting to 
			improve on that knowledge and also gain the knowledge of desktop softwares.
    		</p>
    		
    		<h4>What did I do this past week?</h4>
    		<p id = "What did I do this past week?">
    		I missed the first class day because I was stuck in houston. However, I made it to class on friday, 
    		and we talked about this amazing app named Docker that helps you host a Linux OS on your local machine. 
    		We also talked about assertions in python, and their pros and cons (i.e bad when used in tests!)
    		</p>
    		
    		<h4>What's in my way?</h4>
    		<p id = "What's in my way?">
    		As I am hoping for this to be my last semester I have undertaken quite the task. In addition to CS 373, 
    		I have 3 more CS classes and a British Literature class. I will have to work extra hard to keep up with 
    		all of them. Plus I will need to quickly learn python.
    		</p>
    		
    		<h4>What will I do next week?</h4>
    		<p id = "What will I do next week?">
    		I have a couple CS assignments due next week, and a reading of Chaucers Canterbury Tales also due.
    		</p>
    		
    		<h4>What's my experience of the class?</h4>
    		<p id = "What's my experience of the class?">
    		Professor Downing keeps his students engaged, I especially like how he calls names of students to 
    		answer questions, because it ensures that the students are listening in class and not slacking off 
    		as the semester goes by.
    		</p>
